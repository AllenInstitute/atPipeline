# atPipeline

Pipeline code for processing Array Tomography (AT) data, built as part of [Stephen Smith](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/stephen-j-smith/) group at the (Allen Institute)[https://alleninstitute.org].

The first stages of the pipeline code are specific to data collected within the lab, but most of the steps could be modified for use on similar data.
